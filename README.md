# Intro_Mechatronics

Introduction to Mechatronics (EN.520.240) is an introductory robotic course I took in Fall 2016 at Johns Hopkins University. The course consists of 7 labs and a final project, and each one builds up to the next one. The codes are written for Arduino, and each subfile corresponds to a lab. 

I did lab 3-5 with Eli Pivo and collaborated with Eli, Anthony Garay, and Frances Campbell for lab 6,7 and the final project (Mechaphonics). More details about Mechaphonics can be found in the subfolder.
